HORISEON Website with Refactored Code 

This homework assignment was meant to introduce the idea of refactoring code, including improving the current codebase in HTML and CSS for longterm sustainability and visual aesthetics. Important refactoring tasks included fixing a broken link to an anchor on the page, creating new pathways for images and adding alt text to all images. I also consolidated properties in my CSS file that were for the div classes of the same properties. From a visual standpoint I also altered some colors, fonts, to make this site more cohesive and appealing.
